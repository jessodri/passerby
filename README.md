Passerby is a two sided marketplace for people to arrange pick-up and delivery of items they have purchased or for them to pick-up and deliver an item/s for someone else. 

For example, if someone travels between the CBD and Pakenham each day for work they could potentially pick up an item for someone who may live in Pakenham but is unable to travel into the CBD.

## The Problem

People often want to buy items that require travelling/pick-up. This can be difficult if the buyer does not have a car and/or time to go get the item.

## The Solution

This arrangement benefits both parties as the person receiving the item does not have to travel to pick-up or pay expensive postage. The person delivering the item will earn a little extra money but not have to go out of their way.

## Installation

Git clone or download the app then run the following commands:
* bundle install
* rails db:create
* rails db:migrate
* rails db:seed
* rails s

## Planning Process

### Name

I chose the name Passerby as it suits the idea of people picking up items as they are 'passing by'. I also wanted a name that was short and uncomplicated.

### Trello Board

### User Stories

#### Person Requesting Item

* As a user I want to have my item delivered so that I do not have to drive somewhere to get it
* As a user I want to have my item delivered so that I have time for other things
* As a user I want to have items delivered for a low cost so that I can save money
* As a user I want to be able to find someone to pick-up my item quickly and easily so that I don't have to wait a long time
* As a user  I want to have the freedom to buy items in any location so that I have more options available
* As a user I want to be able to pay online so that we are not dealing with cash payments
* As a user I want to be able to view profiles of people who do pick-ups/drop-off in my area so that I can ask them directly to pick something up
* As a user I want to be able to message the pick-up person directly so that we can make arrangements

#### Person Picking Up Item

* As a user I want to be able to see what items need to be picked up along the route I travel so that I can pick jobs close to me
* As a user I want to find jobs so that I can earn extra money
* As a user I want to know the pick-up and drop-off location so that I can plan my journey
* As a user I want to be able to save jobs to a list so that I can keep track of them
* As a user I want to be paid securely and quickly so that I don't have to harass the requester for payment
* As a user I want to be able to list where I tend to travel so that people can find me and request that I pick an item for them
* As a user I want to have a profile page so that people can find out where I do pick-ups

## Financial Aspect

It will be up to the user to post how much they are willing to pay for the pick-up and delivery of their item as it will vary based on distance and size of the item. I will likely post some recommended guidelines on the site.

For now I plan to charge a one-time sign-up fee to use the website. In future, when my skills have advanced I would like to have a business model in which I receive a percentage of each transaction.

## Design

I wanted to keep my design simple and clean. I chose 3 main colors:

I chose two fonts; Crimson Text for headings and Open Sans for paragraphs.

For my logo I wanted to incorporate the 'P' and 'B' from Passerby.
